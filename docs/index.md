**[ProfilePress](http://profilepress.net/)** is a WordPress plugin that makes building user account forms (such as login, registration, password reset, front-end edit user profile forms) and front-end user profile for WordPress ***stupidly simple***.


To be sure, ProfilePress is incredibly easy to setup and start using.
It is built with the ease and simplicity that any person of any background can get up and running with ProfilePress.
But like any new thing, it always helps to have some documentation to get your feet off the ground.

The sidebar to the left will help you navigate your way around the documentation area of ProfilePress.
